React Router Dom : Routing library => React

It makes me navigate in a single page application (react application) 
=> Controlling components display by a specific path (url)



1 => install react-router-Dom
2=> use browser router in app.js
3 => use Routes as a parent for the <Route> </Route> tags 

<Link to:"adresse"> button h1 </Link> => <Route path:"adresse" element={<MovieList/>}
